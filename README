A JavaCC-based JSON Parser.

The grammar productions are based on the 'railroad' diagrams
at json.org and RFC 4627 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)

JSON objects are represented as Java Maps (concrete class LinkedHashMap)
and JSON arrays are represented as Java Lists (concrete class ArrayList)
